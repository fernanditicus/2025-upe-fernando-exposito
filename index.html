        <p class="date">Week 1: 3-7 February, 2025</p>
        <p>This week I started my guided practices in robotics. As a first task, I was told to recreate the Monaco circuit with realistic heights.
           I started the job in Blender using the GIS addon, which provides realistic maps, so I had a good template to make the circuit line.</p>
        <p>I also installed the robotics simulator Gazebo (Harmonic), which needed a Linux distribution to run. In this case, Ubuntu provides a Windows image that allows working with their system inside Windows.</p>
        <p>Below is a top view capture of the plane that GIS can create with the circuit line I made.</p>

    <div id="entry-2" class="entry">
        <p class="date">Week 2: 10-14 February, 2025</p>
        <p>This week I finished the first version of the circuit, so I went into Gazebo to create a world that includes the track.</p>
        <p>I encountered a few small problems when I first entered the simulator, as it is a completely new environment to get used to. 
            For example, I couldn't import any custom objects, so I tried with a very simple custom cylinder before following the same process with the circuit.</p>
        <p>This helped me learn about the worlds and formats that Gazebo uses to recreate reality.</p>
        <p>I also started the process of including the circuit in the database, but so far, I haven't been able to do it safely. That will be my work for next week, along with
           making a new circuit that you will be able to see in the next entry.</p>
        <p>As I will do every week, here is a new image of my progress, in this case, a Gazebo world with the Monaco track.</p>

    <div id="entry-3" class="entry">
        <p class="date">Week 3: 17-21 February, 2025</p>
        <p>This week, I was out for three days due to a fever, so I could only work for two days.</p>
        <p>Now, I can reveal the circuit I have been working on: Spa, the Belgian track where F1 cars, pilots, and teams deliver one of the best races each year.</p>
        <p>I also started learning about the system that robots use to work in Gazebo, which involves using plugins.</p>
        <p>This week, I have not been very productive, but I am surely making progress in my work.</p>
        <p>I left a Blender image of the circuit, which I managed to texture using the Google Maps satellite view.</p>

    <div id="entry-4" class="entry">
        <p class="date">Week 4: 24-28 February, 2025</p>
        <p>This week, I experienced a setback as I could not open a Gazebo world using ROS 2.</p>
        <p>I asked a colleague for help, so we started working together to solve the issues.</p>
        <p>This led to the realization that I needed to change the computer's operating system. Until now, I have been working with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), 
           but in the end, this caused trouble with some program installations. So, it is better to install a dual-boot system (so I do not have to erase the Windows system I normally use).</p>
        <p>Hopefully, next week I will be able to start working on the new task I have been assigned: an Ackermann robot that follows the race line on the circuits.</p>
        <p>Here you can see Gazebo Harmonic running on my brand-new Ubuntu operating system.</p>
