        <p class="date">Week 1: 3-7 February, 2025</p>
        <p>This week I started my guided practices in robotics. As a first task, I was told to recreate the Monaco circuit with realistic heights.
           I started the job in Blender using the GIS addon, which provides realistic maps, so I had a good template to make the circuit line.</p>
        <p>I also installed the robotics simulator Gazebo (Harmonic), which needed a Linux distribution to run. In this case, Ubuntu provides a Windows image that allows working with their system inside Windows.</p>
        <p>Below is a top view capture of the plane that GIS can create with the circuit line I made.</p>

        <p class="date">Week 2: 10-15 February, 2025</p>
        <p>This week I finished the first version of the circuit, so I went into Gazebo to create a world that includes the track.</p>
        <p>I encountered a few small problems when I first entered the simulator, as it is a completely new environment to get used to. 
            For example, I couldn't import any custom objects, so I tried with a very simple custom cylinder before following the same process with the circuit.</p>
        <p>This helped me learn about the worlds and formats that Gazebo uses to recreate reality.</p>
        <p>I also started the process of including the circuit in the database, but so far, I haven't been able to do it safely. That will be my work for next week, along with
           making a new circuit that you will be able to see in the next entry.</p>
        <p>As I will do every week, here is a new image of my progress, in this case, a Gazebo world with the Monaco track.</p>
